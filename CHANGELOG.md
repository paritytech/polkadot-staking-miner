## [v1.3.1] - 2023-12-27

The main changes of this release are as follows:
- Change the binary name to `polkadot-staking-miner` to publish on crates.io.
- Bump rust MSRV to 1.74
- Change `submit_signed_solution` extrinsic to be mortal
- A runtime upgrade bug was fixed in this release.

### Runtime upgrade bug fixed.

Recently, we noticed that it can be possible that the runtime upgrades won't
upgrade the metadata because the actual runtime upgrade is applied to the block
after `state_subscribeRuntimeVersion` emits an event.

For that reason, the polkadot-staking-miner now subscribes to `system().last_runtime_upgrade()` instead to fix that.

### [Changed]
- refactor: make solution extrinsic mortal ([#728](https://github.com/paritytech/staking-miner-v2/pull/728))
- rename project to polkadot-staking-miner ([#717](https://github.com/paritytech/staking-miner-v2/pull/717))

## [v1.3.0] - 2023-12-15 [YANKED]

The change to subxt-signer broke previous behaviour.

## [v1.2.0] - 2023-11-23

The major changes of this release:
- Trimming has been reworked such that the staking-miner "pre-trims" the solution instead relying on the remote node to perform the trimming.
- The default port number in the URI can now be omitted.
- All dependencies are fetched from crates.io and the staking-miner can now be published on crates.io
- New prometheus metrics "staking_miner_trim_started" and "staking_miner_trim_success" have been added to monitor the trimming status.

### [Changed]
- chore: update deps to publish on crates.io ([#715](https://github.com/paritytech/staking-miner-v2/pull/715))
- refactor(trimming): implement pre-trimming ([#687](https://github.com/paritytech/staking-miner-v2/pull/687))

## [v1.1.0] - 2023-06-15

This release adds a subcommand `info` to detect whether the metadata 
of the staking-miner is compatible with a remote node.

```bash
$ staking-miner --uri wss://rpc.polkadot.io:443 info
Remote_node:
{
  "spec_name": "polkadot",
  "impl_name": "parity-polkadot",
  "spec_version": 9370,
  "impl_version": 0,
  "authoring_version": 0,
  "transaction_version": 20,
  "state_version": 0
}
Compatible: NO

## [v0.1.2] - 2022-01-11

This is a release that adds a couple of new features/CLI options, a useful one is `--dry-run` which will check the validity of
the mined solution which for example can spot if an account has too low balance but it requires that the RPC
endpoint exposes `unsafe RPC methods` to work.

In addition, this release fixes another multiple solution bug.

- feat: add delay and log CLI args  ([#442](https://github.com/paritytech/staking-miner-v2/pull/442))
