## [v0.1.2] - 2022-01-11

This is a release that adds a couple of new features/CLI options, a useful one is `--dry-run` which will check the validity of
the mined solution which for example can spot if an account has too low balance but it requires that the RPC
endpoint exposes `unsafe RPC methods` to work.

In addition, this release fixes another multiple solution bug.

### Added
- feat: add delay and log CLI args  ([#442](https://github.com/paritytech/staking-miner-v2/pull/442))
